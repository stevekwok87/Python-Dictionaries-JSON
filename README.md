# Python Dictionaries and JSON
Demonstration Repository to show how to import data into Python dictionaries and store then using the JSON format.

## Project Structure

1. Create a set of data in a numpy array
2. Store data in a dictionary
3. Run a test interpolation
4. Save the dictionary in a JSON file (including conversion to a list to support JSON serialisation)
5. Load data from the JSON file back into a dictionary (including conversion back to numpy array)
6. Run another test interpolation
